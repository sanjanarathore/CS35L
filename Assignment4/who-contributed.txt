I searched for the line in my commitinfo file and found where the line was introduced:

+# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
+# Indiana generally observes either EST all year, or CST/CDT,
+# but areas near Cincinnati and Louisville use those cities' timekeeping
+# and in 1969 and 1970 the whole state observed daylight time;
+# and there are other exceptions as noted below.
+# Shanks partitions Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
+# and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
+# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.

As you can see, the line is quoted and the origial source was cited which means it was not plagiarism.
