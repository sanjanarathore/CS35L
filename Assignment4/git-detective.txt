    Merge branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo' into maint-2.38
    
    In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a
    merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and
    led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected.
    
    * js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo:
      merge-ort: return early when failing to write a blob
      merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories

However, "* js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo:" indicates that this commit was a merge. The lines under it are descriptions of the commits that are a part of this merge. The commit with the description "fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories" points towards the original commit we are looking for so I used the following git log command to find it:

$ git log --grep="fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories"

I found the original commit:

    merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories
    
    If the blob/tree objects cannot be written, we really need the merge
    operations to fail, and not to continue (and then try to access the tree
    object which is however still set to `NULL`).
    
    Let's stop ignoring the return value of `write_object_file()` and
    `write_tree()` and set `clean = -1` in the error case.
